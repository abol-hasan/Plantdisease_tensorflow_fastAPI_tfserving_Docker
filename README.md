# Tomato_potato_pepper_disease
This is a project based on diseased plant leaf images. The data is given from
this link: https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease

In this project different library are used like tensorflow, scikit-learn, numpy,
 matplotlib, os. At first, it is tried to use different ways of loading and getting data 
in tensorflow and show how they work.

At the first part, only potato diseases are used which consist of only three classes and then
tomato, pepper and potato are used all of them together. The Model is built once using Sequential and
once by Functional API.
